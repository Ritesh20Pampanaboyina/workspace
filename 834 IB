Page 1: Introduction
Purpose: The 834 IB Process is for transferring member enrollment data from the VPHP database to the QNXT system for Managed Long-Term Services & Support (MLTSS) and Medallion 4 (MED4).
Frequency: The process occurs on the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 19th of each month.
Important Notes:
DB maintenance should be paused, and teams must be notified to avoid running other processes (e.g., Mass Adjudication, 835 jobs) that could interfere.
Server Check: Ensure all servers (DH/EU) are online before starting.
Page 2: 834 MLTSS Drop
When MLTSS file is dropped:
Acknowledge the drop and start monitoring the process.
Regularly check the progress of data moving to QNXT (every 10-15 minutes) and ensure there are no errors.
If there’s an issue (e.g., errors in data fetching or process failure), reset BizTalk services or IIS and monitor the BizTalk logs.
Monitor specific file paths to ensure no orphan files are left behind.
When the process is 99.99% complete, notify the team that the MLTSS file has been successfully processed.
Page 3: 834 MED4 Drop
When MED4 file is dropped:
The procedure is similar to the MLTSS drop.
Monitor the data processing and report on its status.
Resolve any processing issues by restarting services (BizTalk, IIS) and checking logs.
Once 99.99% of the file is processed, send a notification and clear the batch jobs to resume normal operations.
This explanation captures the main points of each page in a simple, clear format. Let me know if you need more details on any part!

Here is a detailed, page-by-page breakdown of the 834 IB Process document based on each page:

Page 1: Introduction
Scope: The document focuses on the 834 IB (Inbound) process for the VPHP (Virginia Premier Health Plan) client using MLTSS (Managed Long-Term Services & Support) and MED4 (Medallion 4). This process is used to transfer member enrollment data into the QNXT system.
Process Frequency: The process runs on the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 19th of every month.
Notification: Before starting the process, DB maintenance needs to be stopped. This requires submitting a ticket in advance and notifying teams. During the process, specific jobs (e.g., Mass Adjudication, 835, 834 OB) should not be run to avoid conflicts.
DH EU Servers Bounce: You need to ensure that all servers under the DH (Distribution Hub) are online using the Active Batch Console before proceeding. The services should show a green light.
Page 2: 834 MLTSS Drop
Once the MLTSS file is dropped:
Acknowledge receipt of the file and monitor the process.
Use the process log header to track the process and provide updates every 10-15 minutes.
If errors occur (e.g., the log is not fetched or there’s an error status), reset services like IIS or BizTalk.
Use command prompts or the BizTalk server to restart specific services such as Enterprise Single Sign-On and BizTalk Server Applications if necessary.
Page 3: Orphan Retry Monitoring
Orphan Retry Files: These files should be monitored in the following directories:
C:\Program Files\TriZetto\QNXT Connect\OrphanRetry\Windows\Wait\2
C:\Program Files\TriZetto\QNXT Connect\OrphanRetry\Windows\Wait\3
C:\Program Files\TriZetto\QNXT Connect\OrphanRetry\Windows\Wait\4
C:\Program Files\TriZetto\QNXT Connect\OrphanRetry\Windows\Wait\5
The process is complete when 99.99% of the file is processed, and all queues are clear. Then, you can notify the team and proceed to the next file drop.
Page 4: 834 MED4 Drop
The process for MED4 file drops is very similar to the MLTSS drop:
Monitor the MED4 process for any issues, and update the team with the batch count.
Resolve errors by restarting services like IIS and BizTalk.
Once the process is 99.99% complete, notify the team and resume any batch jobs that were halted for the process (e.g., 835 jobs).
Page 5: BizTalk and SQL Server Maintenance
BizTalk Maintenance: BizTalk services need to be stopped and restarted to maintain the process flow.
Enterprise Single Sign-On Service: Stops and restarts to ensure no issues with data processing.
IISRESET: Needed for QConnect services that support data exchange between the systems.
SQL Query Reference: The document includes SQL scripts to monitor the status of the 834 file processing.
Page 6: SQL Queries for Monitoring
Script 1: Verifies the status of the custom enrollment daily job, ensuring no conflicts during the 834 run.
Script 2: Finds the process log ID for the file being processed, used to monitor data transfer progress.
Script 3: Provides information such as process start time, queueing times, batch counts, and processed records per hour.
Batch Count: The number of member transactions being processed.
Stage ID Records: Shows how many records are processed and how many are left.
Page 7: Execution and Blocking Troubleshooting
Stored Procedure for Blocking Issues: If a process is blocked, this stored procedure will help troubleshoot the issue.
Blocking Queries: These identify blocked SQL sessions and their cause, allowing system admins to resolve the issue.
Page 8: DH and EU Monitoring
Distribution Hub (DH) Monitoring: Ensures that all DH and EU (Execution Units) are responsive before file processing begins.
Thread Count Check: Confirms that the EUs are processing the expected number of transactions.
Orphan Retry Monitoring: Ensures that no transactions are stuck or waiting in queues during processing.
Page 9: Orphan Retry Process
Wait Folders: Transactions may wait in different retry folders (folders 2, 3, 4, and 5). Each retry lasts between 5 and 30 minutes before the transaction is retried.
If a transaction cannot be processed after all retries, it is moved to a dead folder and processing is considered complete.
Page 10: BizTalk Event Viewer and Server Management
BizTalk Event Viewer: Check the Event Viewer after 15-20 minutes of file drop to ensure no file-level failures.
Server Checks: Ensure servers like he1tehpqnxtap66 (SIT) and he1tehpqnxtap67 (UAT) are operating properly.
Use SQL commands (sp_who2 active) to check the current status of the processes and identify any active blocking or performance issues.
