Day 1: Introduction to .NET and C#
1. What is the .NET Framework and why is it important?
Answer: The .NET Framework is a software development platform developed by Microsoft that provides a large library of pre-coded solutions to common programming problems and a runtime environment known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR). It allows developers to create applications that can run on Windows-based systems, and it supports multiple programming languages like C#, VB.NET, and F#.
Example:
csharp
Copy code
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
This simple program demonstrates how the .NET Framework uses the System namespace to enable console output.

2. What is the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in .NET?
Answer: The CLR is the execution engine for .NET applications. It provides various services such as memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, and more. The CLR allows different .NET languages to interoperate by compiling the code into an Intermediate Language (IL), which is then executed by the runtime.
Example:
csharp
Copy code
using System;

namespace CLRExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 5;
            int b = 10;
            int sum = a + b;
            Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
        }
    }
}
The CLR manages the execution of this C# program, handling memory allocation and garbage collection automatically.

3. What is the difference between a class and an object in C#?
Answer: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines properties, methods, and behaviors that the objects created from the class will have. An object is an instance of a class, which means it's a concrete entity based on the class definition.
Example:
csharp
Copy code
public class Car
{
    public string Make { get; set; }
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }

    public void DisplayInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Car: {Year} {Make} {Model}");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Car car = new Car { Make = "Toyota", Model = "Camry", Year = 2020 };
        car.DisplayInfo();
    }
}
Here, Car is a class, and car is an object of the Car class.

4. What are namespaces in C#?
Answer: Namespaces in C# are used to organize code into a hierarchical structure, allowing the grouping of related classes, interfaces, structs, and other types. Namespaces also help avoid naming conflicts by providing a way to fully qualify names of classes and other types.
Example:
csharp
Copy code
using System;

namespace VehicleNamespace
{
    public class Car
    {
        public string Make { get; set; }
        public string Model { get; set; }
    }
}

namespace ProgramNamespace
{
    using VehicleNamespace;

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Car car = new Car { Make = "Honda", Model = "Civic" };
            Console.WriteLine($"Car: {car.Make} {car.Model}");
        }
    }
}
This example demonstrates how the VehicleNamespace is used to organize the Car class separately from the Program class.

5. What is the significance of the Main method in C#?
Answer: The Main method is the entry point of a C# application. When a program is executed, the Main method is the first method that is invoked. It can be defined with or without parameters, and it can return void or an integer, depending on the requirements.
Example:
csharp
Copy code
using System;

namespace MainMethodExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The Main method is the entry point of a C# program.");
        }
    }
}
This example shows a basic Main method, which prints a message to the console when the program starts.

6. What is the .NET Class Library, and how is it used?
Answer: The .NET Class Library is a collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types that are tightly integrated with the CLR. These classes provide a wide range of functionalities such as input/output operations, string manipulation, data collection, and more. Developers use the .NET Class Library to access these pre-built functionalities instead of writing code from scratch.
Example:
csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace ClassLibraryExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
            foreach (int number in numbers)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(number);
            }
        }
    }
}
This example uses the System.Collections.Generic namespace, which is part of the .NET Class Library, to create and manipulate a list of integers.
