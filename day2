Day 2: Core C# Syntax and Data Types
1. What is the structure of a C# program?
Answer: A C# program typically consists of the following components:

Namespace declaration: Groups related classes and allows for logical organization.
Class definition: Defines the blueprint for objects.
Main method: The entry point of the program where execution begins.
Statements and expressions: The instructions executed by the program.
Comments: Used to annotate the code, not executed by the program.
Example:

csharp
Copy code
using System;

namespace HelloWorldApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
This program demonstrates a simple C# structure with a namespace, a class, and a Main method that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. What are value types and reference types in C#?
Answer:

Value types store their data directly in memory. Examples include primitive data types like int, float, char, and bool. These types are stored in the stack.
Reference types store references to their data (memory address) in the heap. Examples include classes, arrays, and strings. When a reference type is assigned to another reference type, both refer to the same memory location.
Example:

csharp
Copy code
// Value type example
int x = 10;
int y = x;  // y gets a copy of x
y = 20;
Console.WriteLine(x);  // Output: 10 (x is unaffected by changes to y)

// Reference type example
int[] arr1 = { 1, 2, 3 };
int[] arr2 = arr1;  // arr2 points to the same memory location as arr1
arr2[0] = 10;
Console.WriteLine(arr1[0]);  // Output: 10 (arr1 is affected by changes to arr2)

3. What is boxing and unboxing in C#?
Answer:

Boxing is the process of converting a value type to an object or any interface type implemented by this value type. When a value type is boxed, it is wrapped inside an object and stored on the heap.
Unboxing is the reverse process, where the value is extracted from the object back to a value type.
Example:

csharp
Copy code
int num = 123;      // Value type
object obj = num;   // Boxing: converting value type to reference type

int unboxedNum = (int)obj;  // Unboxing: converting reference type back to value type
Console.WriteLine(unboxedNum);  // Output: 123

4. What are the basic data types in C# and how are they used?
Answer: C# provides several built-in data types that are categorized into value types and reference types:

Integral types: int, byte, sbyte, short, ushort, long, ulong
Floating-point types: float, double
Decimal type: decimal
Boolean type: bool
Character type: char
String type: string (reference type)
Object type: object (base type of all other types)
Example:

csharp
Copy code
int integer = 100;
float floatingPoint = 10.5f;
double doublePrecision = 99.99;
char character = 'A';
string text = "Hello, C#";
bool isTrue = true;

Console.WriteLine(integer);       // Output: 100
Console.WriteLine(floatingPoint); // Output: 10.5
Console.WriteLine(doublePrecision); // Output: 99.99
Console.WriteLine(character);     // Output: A
Console.WriteLine(text);          // Output: Hello, C#
Console.WriteLine(isTrue);        // Output: True

5. How are variables declared and initialized in C#?
Answer: Variables in C# are declared by specifying the data type followed by the variable name. They can be optionally initialized at the time of declaration. C# supports different types of variables, including local variables, instance variables (fields), and static variables.

Example:

csharp
Copy code
// Declaration and initialization
int age = 25;
double salary = 50000.50;
string name = "John Doe";

// Declaration without initialization
bool isEmployed;
isEmployed = true;  // Initialization after declaration

Console.WriteLine($"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Salary: {salary}, Employed: {isEmployed}");
// Output: Name: John Doe, Age: 25, Salary: 50000.5, Employed: True

6. What are constants in C# and how are they different from variables?
Answer: Constants are immutable values that are known at compile time and cannot be changed once defined. They are declared using the const keyword. Unlike variables, constants cannot be assigned a new value after their initial assignment.

Example:

csharp
Copy code
const double Pi = 3.14159;
const int MaxScore = 100;

Console.WriteLine($"Pi: {Pi}, Max Score: {MaxScore}");
// Output: Pi: 3.14159, Max Score: 100

// The following line would cause a compilation error because Pi is a constant
// Pi = 3.14;

7. What is the difference between var, dynamic, and object in C#?
Answer:

var: The var keyword is used for implicit type declaration. The type is determined by the compiler at compile time, and it cannot change.
dynamic: The dynamic keyword is used for dynamic type declaration. The type is resolved at runtime, and it can change during execution.
object: The object type is the base type of all types in C#. It can hold any data type, but you need to cast it to the appropriate type before using it.
Example:

csharp
Copy code
// var example
var number = 10;   // number is inferred as int
// number = "Hello";  // This would cause a compilation error

// dynamic example
dynamic value = 10;  // value is initially int
value = "Hello";     // Now value is a string

// object example
object obj = 10;   // obj is currently holding an int
Console.WriteLine((int)obj + 5);  // Unboxing and using obj as int

Console.WriteLine($"var: {number}, dynamic: {value}, object: {obj}");
// Output: var: 10, dynamic: Hello, object: 10
