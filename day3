Here are the questions, answers, and examples based on the concepts covered on Day 3:

Day 3: Operators, Control Structures, and Arrays
1. What are the different types of operators in C#?
Answer: C# supports several types of operators:
Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
Relational operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Logical operators: &&, ||, !
Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
Unary operators: +, -, ++, --, !
Ternary operator: condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression
Null-coalescing operator: ??
Example:
csharp
Copy code
int a = 10, b = 20;

// Arithmetic operators
int sum = a + b;
int difference = a - b;

// Relational operators
bool isEqual = a == b;
bool isGreater = a > b;

// Logical operators
bool result = (a > 5) && (b < 30);

// Ternary operator
string max = (a > b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";

Console.WriteLine($"Sum: {sum}, Difference: {difference}, IsEqual: {isEqual}, Result: {result}, Max: {max}");
// Output: Sum: 30, Difference: -10, IsEqual: False, Result: True, Max: b is greater

2. What is the difference between if, else if, and else statements in C#?
Answer:

if statement: Executes a block of code if the specified condition is true.
else if statement: Provides an additional condition to check if the previous if condition was false.
else statement: Executes a block of code if none of the previous conditions are true.
Example:

csharp
Copy code
int number = 15;

if (number > 20)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Number is greater than 20");
}
else if (number > 10)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Number is greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Number is 10 or less");
}
// Output: Number is greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20

3. What are switch statements in C#, and when should they be used?
Answer: The switch statement is a control structure that allows a variable to be tested against a list of values, called cases. The value of the variable is compared with each case, and if a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed. The switch statement is often used when you have multiple conditions to check against a single variable.

Example:

csharp
Copy code
int day = 3;
string dayName;

switch (day)
{
    case 1:
        dayName = "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        dayName = "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        dayName = "Wednesday";
        break;
    case 4:
        dayName = "Thursday";
        break;
    case 5:
        dayName = "Friday";
        break;
    case 6:
        dayName = "Saturday";
        break;
    case 7:
        dayName = "Sunday";
        break;
    default:
        dayName = "Invalid day";
        break;
}

Console.WriteLine($"Day {day}: {dayName}");
// Output: Day 3: Wednesday

4. How do while and do-while loops work in C#?
Answer:

while loop: Repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true. The condition is evaluated before the execution of the loop body.
do-while loop: Similar to the while loop, but the condition is evaluated after the execution of the loop body, ensuring that the loop is executed at least once.
Example:

csharp
Copy code
int i = 1;

// while loop example
while (i <= 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"while loop: {i}");
    i++;
}

int j = 1;

// do-while loop example
do
{
    Console.WriteLine($"do-while loop: {j}");
    j++;
}
while (j <= 5);

// Output:
// while loop: 1
// while loop: 2
// while loop: 3
// while loop: 4
// while loop: 5
// do-while loop: 1
// do-while loop: 2
// do-while loop: 3
// do-while loop: 4
// do-while loop: 5

5. What is a for loop, and how is it different from a foreach loop in C#?
Answer:

for loop: A control structure that allows repeated execution of a block of code for a specified number of iterations. It is typically used when the number of iterations is known.
foreach loop: Used to iterate over the elements of a collection, such as an array or a list, without needing to know the number of elements. The foreach loop is typically used when you want to access each element in a collection.
Example:

csharp
Copy code
// for loop example
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"for loop iteration: {i}");
}

int[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };

// foreach loop example
foreach (int number in numbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"foreach loop element: {number}");
}

// Output:
// for loop iteration: 1
// for loop iteration: 2
// for loop iteration: 3
// for loop iteration: 4
// for loop iteration: 5
// foreach loop element: 10
// foreach loop element: 20
// foreach loop element: 30
// foreach loop element: 40
// foreach loop element: 50

6. What are arrays in C#, and how are they used?
Answer: Arrays in C# are a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, rather than declaring separate variables for each value. Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element has an index of 0.

Example:

csharp
Copy code
// Declaring and initializing an array
int[] numbers = new int[5] { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };

// Accessing array elements
Console.WriteLine($"First element: {numbers[0]}");  // Output: 10
Console.WriteLine($"Second element: {numbers[1]}"); // Output: 20

// Modifying array elements
numbers[2] = 35;
Console.WriteLine($"Modified third element: {numbers[2]}"); // Output: 35

// Iterating over an array using a for loop
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Element at index {i}: {numbers[i]}");
}

// Output:
// Element at index 0: 10
// Element at index 1: 20
// Element at index 2: 35
// Element at index 3: 40
// Element at index 4: 50

7. How are multi-dimensional arrays different from jagged arrays in C#?
Answer:

Multi-dimensional arrays: Arrays that have more than one dimension, like a 2D array (a matrix). All elements are stored in a rectangular grid.
Jagged arrays: Arrays of arrays, where each "row" can have a different length. This creates a jagged or irregular shape.
Example:

csharp
Copy code
// Multi-dimensional array (2D array) example
int[,] matrix = new int[2, 3] 
{ 
    { 1, 2, 3 }, 
    { 4, 5, 6 } 
};
Console.WriteLine($"Element at [0, 1]: {matrix[0, 1]}");  // Output: 2

// Jagged array example
int[][] jaggedArray = new int[2][];
jaggedArray[0] = new int[] { 1, 2 };
jaggedArray[1] = new int[] { 3, 4, 5 };

Console.WriteLine($"Element at [1][2]: {jaggedArray[1][2]}");  // Output: 5
